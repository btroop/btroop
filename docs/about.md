# About

> I'm looking to solve real problems for real people by working with a high-performing team to turn innovative ideas into awesome, beautifully-designed products. I'm most energized when operating as a polymath—drawing upon my collection of broadly technical, multi-functional experiences, interests and skills—to come up with creative, inventive solutions that delight users.
